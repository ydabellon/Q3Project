            <td>Last but not the least is to always be careful around fire; when you're cooking, camping, and  near with a candle. For cooking, be careful leaving the stove/oven on because if you leave it on for too long it will cause a fire. For camping, just be careful with the wood and fire because if you move the wood (that has fire in it) possible chance you might burn the campsite. Lastly, for candles, be careful when you see a candle that is lit up already because if you knock it over, you just caused fire.</td>
